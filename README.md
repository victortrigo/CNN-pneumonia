# Deep Learning for Pneumonia Diagnosis

Pneumonia is an infection of the lung tissue. It is highly visible on chest radiographs. Using the data provided by this [Challenge of Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia), a model for the classification of chest radiographs was built.

Using TensorFlow, a Convolutional Neural Network is built for the classification of chest radiographs; Pneumonia or Normal. The Model obtained an Accuracy = 87% as a measure of generalization.
